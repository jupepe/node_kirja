Callback is an asynchronous function. 
A callback function is called when given task has been completed. 
Node uses lot of callbacks and so you have to know these. 
All Node APIs are written so that they supports callbacks.
With callbacks there is no blocking or wait for any I/O operation
Example: function start reading file and immidiately executes next instruction. Once file has been reader, it will call the callback with content as a parameter.
In CPS, a "continuation function" (read: "callback") is passed as an argument to be called once the rest of that code has been run.
The error-first pattern was introduced into Node core to solve problem of different callback signatures
error first callback: The first argument of the callback is reserved for an error object. The second argument of the callback is reserved for any successful response data.
